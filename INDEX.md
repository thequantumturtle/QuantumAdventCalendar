## Getting Started

Start with Day 1 and work your way through sequentially. Each day builds on previous knowledge.

### For Each Day:
1. Read `challenge.md` - understand the concept
2. Work on implementing your solution
3. Compare with `solution.py`
4. Run `test.py` to verify your understanding

Good luck! 🚀
